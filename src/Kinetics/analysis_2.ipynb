    "## Kinetics Par 2: Extracting $k_\\infty$ as a function of temperature ##\n",

    "This last equation can be integrated by separating variables. Informally, this looks like just multiplying through by $dt$ to get the differential relation<br><br>\n",
    "$$\\frac{1}{[\\text{tBP}]} d[\\text{tBP}] = - k_\\infty  dt .$$<br>\n",
    "Integrating both sides gives<br><br>\n",
    "$$ \\ln [\\text{tBP}] = - k_\\infty t + \\ln [\\text{tBP}]_0.$$<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the ideal gas law, we also derived an expression for expressing $[\\text{tBP}]$ in terms of the total pressure ($P_\\text{tot}$) and initial pressure ($P_\\text{o}$) in the reaction chamber:<br><br>\n",

In the analysis code below, you'll make use of this relationship by plotting the quantity $\\ln \\frac{ 3 P_\\text{o} - P_\\text{tot} }{2}$ as a function of $t$ and using the slope of the resulting best-fit line to determine $k_\\infty$ from the relationship:\n",
