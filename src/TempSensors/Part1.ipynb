    "3. Increase the water bath temperature by around 5 $^\\text{o}$C. To do this, turn on all 4 heaters in the water bath. Heaters 1, 2 and 3 are connected to the Sargent Thermonitor controller unit, while heater 4 is operated independently with a Variac powerstat controller. Verify that heaters \\#1, 2 and 3 are on by observing that the red heating indicator lamp on the Thermonitor controller is ON (if not, rotate the COARSE control knob clockwise as far as it will go). When the water bath is close to the desired temperature, turn off ALL heaters except heater \\#1, which is needed to maintain a constant T above room temperature in the bath. At this point, allow the water bath temperature to stabilize. Once the resistance output of the RTD and thermistor are stable, then the data can be attained.\n"

    "## Your Assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "Your lab today consists of three parts: \n",
    "1. In **Part 1**, you will manually measure the temperature of a heated water bath at different temperatures using an RTD, a thermistor, and a blue spirit thermometer (similar to a traditional mercury thermometer, but using isoamyl benzoate and a blue dye insted of mercury). This will give you a chance to get familiar with how each sensor works. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. In **Part 2**, you will use a LabView program to automatically monitor the temperature of the RTD and thermistor sensors as they are rapidly heated in a water bath and then air cooled. This will allow you to compare the rate at which each sensor responds to temperature changes, as well as the relative rates of air- vs water-mediated heating and cooling. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. In **Part 3**, you'll enter your data into a Jupyter Notebook template, plot the data, analyze the results, and answer questions about your observations. In this part of the assignment, you'll use the fit equations displayed in the information boxes above to \"translate\" your experimental resistance values to temperature in Kelvins. You'll upload a PDF copy of this work to Brightspace as your completed lab assignment. \n",
