    "In this first experiment you will perform a simple set of temperature measurements with two different types of temperature sensors and then plot and analyze the results using a Jupyter Notebook and the Python programming language. The goals of this experiment are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To introduce you to **two different types of electronic temperature sensor** -- and hopefully to get you thinking about how different types of instruments affect experimental measurements. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. To introduce you to **Python programming using the Jupyter Notebook interface** on nanoHUB.org. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. To introduce **Python commands** for three basic operations:\n",
    "    - Manually entering data into a Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "    - Automatically importing data into Jupyter Notebook from a text file\n",
    "    - Plotting data using the NumPy and Matplotlib libraries. \n",
    "\n",
    "You'll use these operations in almost every lab this semester, so use this opportunity to learn how they work. In this first lab, all the Python code will be provided for you, but later in the semester you'll have to learn to write the code yourself!\n",

    "## Your Assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "Your lab today consists of three parts: \n",
    "1. In **Part 1**, you will manually measure the temperature of a heated water bath at different temperatures using an RTD, a thermistor, and a blue spirit thermometer (similar to a traditional mercury thermometer, but using isoamyl benzoate and a blue dye insted of mercury). This will give you a chance to get familiar with how each sensor works. Click the button for detailed instructions. <br><a href=\"Part1.ipynb\"> <button class=\"p-Widget jupyter-widgets jupyter-button widget-button mod-warning\" style=\"width:100px; background-color:#E9E9E9; font-size:10pt; color:black\">Go!</button></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In **Part 2**, you will use a LabView program to automatically monitor the temperature of the RTD and thermistor sensors as they are rapidly heated in a water bath and then air cooled. This will allow you to compare the rate at which each sensor responds to temperature changes, as well as the relative rates of air- vs water-mediated heating and cooling. Click the button for detailed instructions. <br><a href=\"Part2.ipynb\"> <button class=\"p-Widget jupyter-widgets jupyter-button widget-button mod-warning\" style=\"width:100px; background-color:#E9E9E9; font-size:10pt; color:black\">Go!</button></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In **Part 3**, you'll enter your data into a Jupyter Notebook template, plot the data, analyze the results, and answer questions about your observations. In this part of the assignment, you'll use the fit equations displayed in the information boxes above to \"translate\" your experimental resistance values to temperature in Kelvins. You'll upload a PDF copy of this work to Brightspace as your completed lab assignment. \n",
