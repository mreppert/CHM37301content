    "The solid P7 dye is provided for you dissolved in ethanol at a concentration of $1.2\\cdot 10^{-5} M$. Briefly, you are to collect %T spectra for the provided dye solution, along with dilutions at 1/2, 1/4, and 1/8 the starting concentration. Because the dye is dissolved in ethanol, you will use a cuvette filled with pure ethanol as the \"blank\" when you measure each spectrum. "
