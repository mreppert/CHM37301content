    "\n",
    "Last week, you learned some basic techniques in optical absorption measurements. This week, you'll collect absorption data on a series of linear polyene dyes and see how such optical measurements \"shed light\" (pun intended) on the mechanical rules that govern our world at the atomic scale. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quantum vs. Classical ####\n",
    "\n",
    "In your lecture, you've probably already heard the terms \"quantum\" and \"classical\", but it's not surprising if the distinction between them isn't particularly clear yet. Briefly, these two terms represent different theories of how the physical world operates: *quantum mechanics* (or quantum theory) is \"the physics of the very small\", i.e., it describes how physical objects and fields behave when the spatial and energy scales involved are very small (think: electrons). *Classical mechanics* is \"the physics everyday life\", i.e., it describes how objects and fields behave under the physical conditions we interact with in daily life (think: baseballs and cars). There is yet a third domain of physical theory, *relativistic physics* which describes very large and energetic systems (think: planets and galaxies), but relativistic effects aren't common in physical chemistry. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll start to develop some intuition for the differences between quantum and classical mechanics. In particular, you'll measure experimentally the optical absorption spectra for a series of linear polyene dyes (see structures below) and see that their measured peak absorption wavelengths follow the predictions of quantum mechanics -- and *not* the predictions of classical mechanics.

All three of the dye molecules above have a long stretch of linear, conjugated double bonds in the middle. Because the bonds are all conjugated, electrons are able to move back and forth across the molecule quite freely, almost (as illustrated below) as though they are contained in a narrow \"box\" whose length is just the length of that conjugated stretch of double bonds. <img src=\"img/P9pib.png\" width=\"300\"/>\n",
