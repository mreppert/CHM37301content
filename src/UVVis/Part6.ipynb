    "# Part 6: Quantum Particle in a Box\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Rules ###\n",
    "\n",
    "In quantum mechanics, particles acquire a \"wavelike\" character, which means that they can't be described simply as a point-particle that moves with time. Instead, quantum dynamics involve changes to the particle's \"wave function\" -- a somewhat mysterious creature that (when it's absolute value is squared) gives the probability that a measurement would find the particle in any particular region of space at a given time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even for simple systems like the particle in a box, a complete description of quantum dynamics would be very difficult without first explaining quite a bit of background in quantum theory. For today's purposes, we'll do all the derivations and ask you to keep in mind three rules: \n",
    "1. **The dynamical frequencies** of a quantum system are determined by the spacing between its energy levels via the formula $$ \\nu_{mn} = \\frac{E_m - E_n}{h}$$\n",
    "where $E_m$ and $E_n$ are the energies of two different energy states $m$ and $n$, and $h = 6.626\\cdot 10^{-34} J\\cdot s$ is *Planck's constant*. Note that every quantum system can have many different frequencies $\\nu_{mn}$ associated with it, depending on the number and spacing of its energy levels. Any and all of these frequencies can show up in a spectroscopic measurements!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The energy levels** $E_n$ for a quantum system are the *eigenvalues* of the time-independent Schrodinger equation\n",
    "$$ \\hat H \\psi_n = E_n \\psi_n$$\n",
    "where $\\psi_n$ is the *wavefunction* associated with the energy level $n$, and $\\hat H$ is the *Hamiltonian Operator* defined (for a single particle) as\n",
    "$$ \\hat H = - \\frac{h^2}{8 m \\pi^2} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + V(x),$$\n",
    "with $V(x)$ the potential energy function that holds the particle in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The wavefunction** must satisfy the *boundary conditions* of the system. For a particle in a box, this means that $\\psi(x)$ must decay to zero by the time it reaches the walls of the box, reflecting the fact that the particle isn't allowed to travel outside the box. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution ###\n",
    "\n",
    "From these basic rules, it's possible to deduce that the allowed wavefunctions for a particle in a box have the form\n",
    "$$\\psi_n(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L}} \\sin \\left ( \\frac{n \\pi x}{L} \\right).$$ The factor of $\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L}}$ in front of the sin wave ensures that the wavefunction is *normalized*, i.e., that its squared amplitude ($| \\psi^2(x) |$) integrates to 1 across the box length (zero to L); this reflects the fact that, regardless of which energy state the particle is in, it must be found *somewhere* between 0 and L. \n",
    "\n",
    "From the Time-independent Schrodinger equation above, we can calculate the allowed energy levels: \n",
    "$$ \\hat H \\psi_n = - \\frac{h^2}{8 m \\pi^2} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L}} \\sin \\left ( \\frac{n \\pi x}{L} \\right) . $$\n",
    "Note that since the particle is free inside the box, $V(x) = 0$ so long as the particle stays inside the box! Differentiating twice with respect to $x$ gives \n",
    "$$ \\hat H \\psi_n = - \\frac{h^2}{8 m \\pi^2} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L}} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 }{L^2} \\right) \\sin \\left ( \\frac{n \\pi x}{L} \\right)  $$\n",
    "or simply \n",
    "$$ \\hat H \\psi_n = \\frac{h^2 n^2 }{8 m L^2} \\sin \\left ( \\frac{n \\pi x}{L} \\right) \\psi_n. $$\n",
    "Comparing this result with the time-independent Schrodinger equation ($\\hat H \\psi_n = E_n \\psi_n$), we conclude that for the quantum particle in a box:\n",
    "$$E_n = \\frac{h^2 n^2 }{8 m L^2}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Frequencies ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know the energy levels for our boxed particle, we are ready to calculate transition frequencies. But which energy levels should we consider? Our first rule above tells us that $\\nu_{mn} = \\frac{E_m - E_n}{h}$, but it doesn't tell us which values of $m$ and $n$ we should consider in our experiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "As it turns out (and as you could determine by studying the dye absorption spectra over a wider range of wavelengths) the absorption measurements that you've made correspond to the movement of the highest-energy $\\pi$ electron in the conjugated dye system to the next-highest energy level: an $N \\to N+1$ transiton. The value of $N$ is determined by the number of $\\pi$ electrons in the molecule. As depicted below, each double bond in the polyene chain contributes 2 $\\pi$ electrons, while the lone pair of the neutral N atom contributes an extra 2. Thus the total number of electrons in our \"box\" is \n",
    "$$N_e = N_C + 3,$$\n",
    "where $N_C$ is the number of carbons in the conjugated chain (i.e., between the two N atoms). \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/P5bonds.png\" width=\"300\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, since each energy level in the molecule can hold *two* electrons, the highest-occupied energy level is actually \n",
    "$$ N = \\frac{N_e}{2}.$$\n",
    "We can thus calculate the expected transition frequency for each molecule as \n",
    "$$ \\nu = \\frac{E_{N+1} - E_{N}}{h} = \\frac{h^2 \\left( (N+1)^2 - N^2 \\right) }{h 8 m L^2} = \\frac{h \\left( 2N + 1 \\right) }{8 m L^2} = \\frac{h \\left( N_e + 1 \\right) }{8 m L^2}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions ###\n",
    "\n",
    "In the formula above, the value of Planck's constant $h$ has already been stated, and the quantity $m$ is just the electron mass $m = 9.11\\cdot 10^{-31}$ kg. You can calculate the number of electrons $N_e$ from the formula above by just counting the number of carbons (between the N atoms!) in each conjugated chain. \n",
    "\n",
    "The last parameter we need to estimate is the length of the box. To estimate this for yourself, go back to the \"Intro\" file for this lab where the structure of the three dye molecules were displayed interactively. To measure the distance between two atoms in these interactive structures:\n",
    "1. *Right-click* on the first atom.\n",
    "2. *Double-right-click* on the second atom.\n",
    "\n",
    "A line will pop up between the two atoms with the distance (in Angstroms) written in small black letters above the middle of the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "To read the numbers you may well need to make the figure larger: to do that, just double-click on the white space behind the molecule. This will bring you into full-screen mode. (Hit your \"escape\" key to exit.) You can zoom in or out of the image by scrolling with the center-wheel on your mouse. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, estimate the \"length\" of the molecular box by measuring (see image below) between both\n",
    "1. The length $L_1$ between the two N atoms and\n",
    "2. The length $L_2$ between the outermost carbons of the terminal phenyl rings at each end of the molecule. \n",
    "\n",
    "In your lab notebook, tabulate these two values, $L_1$ and $L_2$ for each of the three dye molecules. You'll use them in your lab report. \n",
